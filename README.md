# Implementation of the Giskard Consensus Protocol for the Hyperledger Sawtooth modular blockchain

The Giskard consensus protocol is used to validate transactions and computations in the [PlatON network](https://platon.network) and tolerates Byzantine failures among participating nodes.

In earlier work from 2020, Giskard was specified [informally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02124) as well as [formally in the Coq proof assistant](https://github.com/runtimeverification/giskard-verification). The Coq formalization is described in a [technical report](https://github.com/runtimeverification/giskard-verification/releases/download/v1.0/report.pdf).
